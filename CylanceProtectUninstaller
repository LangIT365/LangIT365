 *  Support Script: Uninstall_Cleanup_EPP_EDR.ps1
 *  Created: 06/13/2022 by SDS
 *  Updated: 11/23/2022 by SDS
 *  Version: 2.9
 *  Tracked via: SDT00052661
 *  Description: Script to automate the windows cleanup of Cylance Protect and Cylance Optics - KB 66473
 *  
 *  Instructions for running script:
 *    1. Run the script with the safemode flag set to "yes" to see what the script will do without making any deletes/removes
 *    2. When ready to make changes, set the safemode flag set to "No"
 *    3. Run the script (as Administrator) to make the changes
 *       Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
 *    4. Its likely you may need to reboot and re-run the script again
 *
 *  You may also run the script using NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM using psexec (/k to .exe should be in single quotes)
 *    1. Start-Process -FilePath cmd.exe -Verb Runas -ArgumentList /k C:\PsExec.exe -i -s powershell.exe
 *    2. .\Uninstall_Cleanup_EPP_EDR.ps1
 * 
 * Switches:
 *   -safemode Yes/No (safemode Yes will not make any changes)
 *   -attempteduninstall Yes (suppress any warnings advising have you attempted to uninstall once)
 *
 * Example for unintended runs
 * Example: .\Uninstall_Cleanup_EPP_EDR.ps1 -safemode No -attempteduninstall Yes
 * Example: .\Uninstall_Cleanup_EPP_EDR.ps1 -safemode Yes -attempteduninstall Yes
